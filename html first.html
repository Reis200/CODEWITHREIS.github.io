                <h4>Why did I start:</h4>
                <p>
                    I started my channel around summer 2021. I think it was a good decision...
                    I started because I think to myself and said: "You have a little bit of knowledge on programming and you are improving yourself as well,
                    why not start a channel and be helpful for other people ". This was my goal from the beginning it was to help people and be part of something
                    good as teaching. I hope I could have helped :D. I will try my best to be means for your needs.
